Xkcd
================
Xkcd is now installed!
You can now acces the following commands from the command palette (cmd+shift+p / ctr+shift+p):
- Xkcd: Latest
- Xkcd: List
- Xkcd: Random

"Latest" and "Random" will open the latest and a random xkcd comic
respectively, while "List" will open a searchable quick panel showing title,
comic number and publication data for each comic.

"Random" is bound to "ctrl+alt+x" by default.

You can manually set the line width of the alt text in your user preference file, which is available via the menu "Preferences" => "Package Settings" => "Xkcd" etc.

If you encounter any bugs, please open an issue on
